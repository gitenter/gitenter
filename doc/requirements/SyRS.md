## Introduction

### System purpose

*(Define the reason(s) for which the system is being developed or modified.)*

### System scope

**System name:**

**Results of finalized needs analysis:** *((1) A brief but clear expression of the user's problem(s). (2) The system will and will not do to satisfy those needs.)*

**Application of the system:** *(All relevant top level benefits, objectives, and goals.)*

### System overview

#### System context

*(Describe at a general level the major elements of the system, to include human elements, and how they interact. The system overview includes appropriate diagrams and narrative to provide the context of the system, defining all significant interfaces crossing the system's boundaries.)*

#### System functions

*(Describe major system capabilities, conditions and constraints.)*

#### User characteristics

*(Identify each type of user/operator/maintainer of the system (by function, location, type of device), the number
in each group, and the nature of their use of the system.)*
