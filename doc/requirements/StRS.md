## Stakeholders

We'll divide our stakeholders into three different parties.

Customer:

- R&D engineers (users).
- Companies which obey quality control procedure.
- Regulatory departments.

Technical:

- Developers.
- Operational engineers.
- Infrastructure provider.

Business:

- Owners. *(profitability/market share/succession planning)*
- Distributor/partner.
- Shareholders/investors. *(return of investment/income)*
- Employees. *(Job satisfaction)*

These parties are equally important for the success of the product. But in this series of documents, we'll concentrate mostly for the customer and technical concerns.
