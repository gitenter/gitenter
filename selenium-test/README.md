# Selenium

## Setup

### Mac OS

Need to install standalone selenium server:

```
$ brew install selenium-server-standalone
```

python library:

```
$ pip3 install selenium
```

and browser driver:

+ Download `geckodriver` (Firefox, from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)) and `ChromeDriver` (from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)). There is a Mac OS version to choose. The target is a standalone executable file.
+ Throw is to any path listed in `/etc/paths`, e.g., `/usr/local/bin`.

```
$ mv geckodriver /usr/local/bin
$ mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin
```

Add add-ons (a.k.a Selenium IDEs) to the existing browsers ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide/), ...) has nothing to do with the corresponding drivers (`ChromeDriver`, `GeckoDriver`, ...). That's for create simple scripts/assist in exploratory testing. Also, notice that add add-ons is a user-level action (no password needed).

## Run Tests

```
python3 -m unittest test.authorization_test
```
