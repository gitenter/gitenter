# Sharing user's session in a database or a file system (suggested Redis)
# Alternative approach should be using sticky sessions (setup in load balance)
# with session replication (setup in server).
#
# General information for difference choices:
# https://www.haproxy.com/blog/load-balancing-affinity-persistence-sticky-sessions-what-you-need-to-know/
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10494431/sticky-and-non-sticky-sessions
#
# We also enabled sticky session as it can open the possibility for local
# RAM caching.
#
# We'll not do session replication as it has no need to go with Spring session.
# Also, since AWS doesn't support multicast between different zones, this is really
# hard to implement. Therefore, we decide to go with Spring session.
# Anyway, to setup sesson replication in Tomcat we can refer:
# https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/cluster-howto.html
# https://icicimov.github.io/blog/high-availability/Tomcat7-clustering-and-session-replication/
#
# Refer to: https://docs.spring.io/spring-session/docs/2.1.6.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/html5/guides/boot-redis.html
#
# To clean up the session keys, one can just log into Redis and flush all:
# > $ redis-cli
# > 127.0.0.1:6379> KEYS *
# > 127.0.0.1:6379> FLUSHALL
#
# TODO:
# May consider use JWT rather than session based authorization, then we don't need
# Redis in here anymore (may also use Redis/Memcached for caching).
